v0.1
- basic server-client that handle three models of RPC calls:
	- command1, which does not require answer
	- command2, which requires answer
	- command3, which requires answer and is handled by other server, thus using the server as proxy
- command2 and command3 are the same from the perspective of the client
- multitasking (every request is a different coroutine) exists from the beginning
